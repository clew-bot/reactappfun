              My journey of coding was initiated in mid 2020's with the goal of
              becoming an employed software developer somewhere. I'm still on
              course learning as many useful tools that comes in my way. I
              specialize in the M.E.R.N stack because I believe noSQL is the
              future of large scaleable databases, React library for rendering
              components, Express framework for building a fully-fledged web
              application, and Node as the main runtime environment for
              Javascript.
